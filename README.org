* daemonize.sh

...is a simple script that bootstraps runit services. It copies an
optional skeleton creates the necessary supervise directories and
links for the service and an associated logger.

Skeletons mostly consist of a 'run' file and any settings and other
config files. For some examples see https://github.com/stef/tunnel-daemons

Running is simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./daemonize.sh service
#+END_SRC

This creates all necessary files in /etc/sv/service. Go and edit
/etc/sv/service/run to add the command line to start the service after
the exec. Make very sure that this service runs in the foreground,
otherwise you can easily create a forkbomb this way. Easiest to check
is by running ./run and making sure it does block and provide the
expected service.

Warning: This is only tested under debian, if you want to run it on other OSes
you should adapt your paths in the source.
